# E-Commerce Back-End

## Description
This application is an E-Commerce Back-End API designed to manage and interact with the data of an online retail company. It provides the necessary functionality for managing products, categories, and tags, enabling the company to effectively organize and maintain their product inventory. Through this API, users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database, allowing for seamless management of product data and their associations with categories and tags.
The application provides initial seeding of data to quickly setup and test the application. The API endpoints can then be tested in a tool like Insomnia or Postman. Some starter code existed for this project and the technologies used include Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, PostgreSQL and dotenv. 

## Usage
Users can note the syntax of PostgreSQL login credentials in the .env.EXAMPlE file and then create their own .env file, replacing the examples with their own credentials. The application can then be run from the terminal after connecting to the database and running the seed file. All the terminal commands can be seen in the video walkthrough provided below, as well as the testing of the API routes using Insomnia.
